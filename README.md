# Word Similarity using Gensim

This code demonstrates how to use Gensim library to calculate word similarity and find the most similar words. It leverages the pre-trained "word2vec-google-news-300" model to perform these tasks.


**Functionality:**

1. Installs the `gensim` library.
2. Downloads the `word2vec-google-news-300` pre-trained model.
3. Calculates the word vector for given word.
4. Finds the most similar words.
5. Calculates the similarity between words.


**Usage:**

1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Run the code in a Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook environment.


**Dependencies:**

- gensim
- numpy
